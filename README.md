# fare-prediction-model
Our taxi fare predictor model utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to accurately estimate taxi fares based on various input features such as trip distance, passenger count, and pickup time. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical taxi ride information and has been fine-tuned to minimize errors in fare predictions.
