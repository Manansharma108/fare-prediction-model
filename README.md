# fare-prediction-model
Our taxi fare predictor model utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to accurately estimate taxi fares based on various input features such as trip distance, passenger count, and pickup time. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical taxi ride information and has been fine-tuned to minimize errors in fare predictions.
### Taxi Fare Price Predictor
Aim of the Project:
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts taxi fare prices based on various input parameters such as trip distance, passenger count, and pickup time. By leveraging historical taxi ride data, the model aims to provide users with reliable estimates for taxi fares, helping them plan their journeys more effectively and budget efficiently.

# Tech Stack:
Machine Learning Algorithms: The model utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method capable of handling complex datasets and delivering accurate predictions.
Tools: Python programming language is used along with popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
# Project Description:
Our taxi fare predictor model employs the Random Forest algorithm to estimate taxi fares based on a variety of input features. These features include trip distance, passenger count, and pickup time, among others. The model is trained on a robust dataset containing historical taxi ride information, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships between input features and fare prices. By minimizing prediction errors, the model provides users with dependable estimates for taxi fares, enabling them to plan and budget their journeys effectively. Through continuous refinement and optimization, our goal is to develop a reliable and accurate tool that enhances the overall taxi ride experience for users.
